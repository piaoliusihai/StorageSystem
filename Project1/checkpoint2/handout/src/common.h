 *
 * Two basic interfaces for FTL are ReadTranslate() and WriteTranslate(),
 * which are called for read and write operations. Both member functions
 * accept the LBA (linear block address, which is the linear address of
 * a page - do not be confused by the obsolete terminology "block address")
 * and a vector pointer as arguments. The LBA is the input argument, and
 * the vector is an output argument.
 *
 * The element of the output vector argument is std::pair<OpCode, Address>.
 * This vector represents the sequence of operations that should be performed
 * by the controller in order to conduct the operation requested (read/write).
 * OpCode is a enum class defined as the operation an FTL should perform,
 * which are READ, WRITE and ERASE (we only need these three, though in
 * a real SSD the instructions are far more richer than our simple model).
 * Address is class Address object, which points to the page or block the
 * operation should be performed on.
 *
 * If the operation is READ or WRITE, then all five fields in Address will
 * be used. Otherwise for MERGE, Only the first four fields in Address will
 * be used, and "page" field will be ignored.
